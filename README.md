2. Project Workflow:
a. Data Collection:
IMDb Movie Reviews Dataset: The IMDb dataset is a well-known dataset for binary sentiment classification. It contains 50,000 movie reviews, equally split into positive and negative reviews. The dataset is commonly available in libraries such as nltk, keras.datasets, or Kaggle.
Example:
Positive Review: "The movie was fantastic, with great acting and a strong plot!"
Negative Review: "The film was boring, and the story made no sense."
b. Data Preprocessing:
Text Cleaning:
Convert all text to lowercase to maintain uniformity.
Remove special characters, punctuation, and stop words (like "the", "is", "in") that do not add significant meaning.
Tokenization: Split text into individual words or tokens.
Lemmatization or Stemming: Reduce words to their root forms (e.g., "running" → "run").
Handling Imbalanced Data: If the dataset is not balanced (equal distribution of positive and negative reviews), techniques like undersampling or oversampling might be necessary.
c. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Word Frequency Analysis: Analyze the most frequent words in positive and negative reviews.
Word Clouds: Create word clouds for visualizing commonly occurring words in positive vs negative reviews.
Review Length Analysis: Look at the length distribution of positive and negative reviews.
d. Feature Extraction:
Bag of Words (BoW): Create a matrix of word counts, where each row represents a review and each column represents a unique word. The value in each cell is the frequency of the word in that review.
TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency): Another technique that adjusts word counts based on how important or rare a word is across the entire dataset.
Word Embeddings: Use pre-trained embeddings like Word2Vec or GloVe to represent words in a dense vector space.
N-grams: Consider combinations of words (e.g., bigrams like "not good") for more context in sentiment.
e. Train-Test Split:
Split the dataset into training and testing sets (commonly 80%-20% or 70%-30%).
Optionally, create a validation set to fine-tune the model and prevent overfitting.
f. Model Selection:
You can use a variety of machine learning or deep learning models for sentiment analysis:
Classical Machine Learning Models:
Logistic Regression: A simple and effective model for binary classification tasks.
Naive Bayes: A probabilistic model that's often used for text classification.
Support Vector Machine (SVM): Useful for high-dimensional spaces like text data.
Random Forest: An ensemble model that can improve performance in some cases.
Deep Learning Models:
Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN): These are designed to capture sequential patterns in text.
Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM): A type of RNN that is excellent at capturing long-range dependencies in text.
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN): CNNs have also been used in text classification to capture local patterns in text.
Transformers (BERT, GPT): These state-of-the-art models are pre-trained on vast amounts of text and perform exceptionally well in NLP tasks like sentiment analysis.
g. Model Training:
Train the selected model on the training data, using the feature vectors created by methods like Bag of Words, TF-IDF, or embeddings.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Use techniques like grid search or random search to fine-tune the hyperparameters of your model.
h. Model Evaluation:
Metrics: Evaluate the model’s performance using:
Accuracy: Percentage of correctly classified reviews.
Precision and Recall: Precision measures the percentage of correct positive predictions, while recall measures how well the model identifies all positive reviews.
F1 Score: A harmonic mean of precision and recall, useful when the data is imbalanced.
Confusion Matrix: A matrix that shows the number of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.
i. Model Interpretation:
For classical models, interpret the features (words) that contributed most to the positive or negative classification.
For deep learning models, interpret the attention weights (if using models like BERT) to understand which parts of the text the model focused on.
3. Technologies and Libraries Used:
Python: Programming language.
Libraries:
Text Preprocessing: nltk, spacy, re (regular expressions).
Feature Extraction: sklearn.feature_extraction.text (for BoW, TF-IDF), gensim (for Word2Vec), tensorflow or torch (for deep learning embeddings).
Modeling: scikit-learn (for classical models), tensorflow or torch (for deep learning models like LSTM, CNN, or transformers).
Evaluation: scikit-learn for metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix.
4. Challenges and Considerations:
Data Imbalance: You may encounter imbalanced datasets, where more reviews are positive than negative or vice versa. Techniques like oversampling or SMOTE can be used.
Overfitting: Be cautious of overfitting, especially with deep learning models. Use regularization techniques like dropout or early stopping.
Interpretability: Deep learning models (like LSTMs) are harder to interpret than classical models (like Logistic Regression or Naive Bayes).
5. Extensions and Improvements:
Use Pretrained Models (BERT): Leverage pre-trained language models like BERT or DistilBERT for state-of-the-art performance.
Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis: Analyze sentiment based on specific aspects (e.g., acting, plot) within a review rather than an overall sentiment score.
